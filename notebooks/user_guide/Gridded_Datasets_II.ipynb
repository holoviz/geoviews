    "\n",
    "A HoloViews Dataset is a wrapper around a complex multi-dimensional datastructure which allows the user to convert their data into individually visualizable views, each usually of lower dimensionality. This is done by grouping the data by some dimension and then casting it to a specific Element type, which visualizes itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``dataset.to`` interface makes this especially easy.  To use it, you supply the Element type that you want to view the data as and the key dimensions of that view and it will figure out the rest. Depending on the type of Element, you can specify one or more dimensions to be displayed. GeoViews provides a set of GeoElements that allow you to display geographic data on a cartographic projection, but you can use any Elements from HoloViews for non-geographic plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the cube we are working with has 4 coordinate dimensions (or key dimensions as they are known in HoloViews) -- time, realization, longitude, and latitude.  For our purposes, a geographic plot is defined as a plot that has longitude along the x axis and latitude along the y axis. To declare a two-dimensional geographic plot, we therefore simply request a `gv.Image` plot with ``longitude`` and ``latitude`` as key dimensions.  There is one value dimension (vdim) available, ``surface_temperature``, and any remaining key dimensions (``time`` and ``realization`` in this case) are assigned to a ``HoloMap`` data structure by default.  The resulting ``HoloMap`` gives you widgets automatically to allow you to explore the data across the two \"remaining\" key dimensions (those not mapped onto axes of the image):"
